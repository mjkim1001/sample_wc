CS45_1,Pseudo-Quantile Functional Data Clustering,Joonpyo Kim|Hee-Seok Oh,"This paper studies the problem of functional data clustering. Functional data have their own characteristics and contain rich information that cannot be obtained when regarding the data as multivariate data. Functional data are inherently infinite-dimensional, so classical clustering techniques for finite-dimensional data may not be suitable for functional data. There are several clustering methods for functional data based on probabilistic models or basis expansion approaches. However, most of these depend on the symmetric structure of the model or the mean response; hence, these cannot reflect characteristics of the distribution of data beyond the mean, such as behavior at the extremes. In this paper, we propose a new approach for functional data clustering based on the concept of an asymmetric norm. For this purpose, we consider pseudo-quantiles, such as M-quantiles and expectiles, and their corresponding curves that can provide rich distributional information about hidden structures in the data at various levels. Moreover, as a theoretical justification for the proposed method, a strong consistency property is investigated. Results from numerical examples, including real data analysis, demonstrate the promising empirical properties of the proposed approach.",functional data,CS Mon 1
IS8_1,Spherical Principal Curves,Jongmin Lee|Jang-Hyun Kim|Hee-Seok Oh,"This paper presents a new approach for dimension reduction of data observed on spherical surfaces. Several dimension reduction techniques have been developed in recent years for non-Euclidean data analysis. As a pioneer work, Hauberg (2016) attempted to implement principal curves on Riemannian manifolds. However, this approach uses approximations to process data on Riemannian manifolds, resulting in distorted results. This study proposes a new approach to project data onto a continuous curve to construct principal curves on spherical surfaces. Our approach lies in the same line of Hastie and Stuetzle (1989) that proposed principal curves for data on Euclidean space. We further investigate the stationarity of the proposed principal curves that satisfy the self-consistency on spherical surfaces. The results on the real data analysis and simulation examples show promising empirical characteristics of the proposed approach.",noneuclidean,IS Mon 1
